#iGuide
iGuide is an Android application that allows for easy mapping within buildings. The overall goal of 
iGuide is to accurately assist in user navigation from current location to a destination they select.
In addition, the app is adaptable so when things are added to the Open Street Map database, it will become 
searchable within app.
